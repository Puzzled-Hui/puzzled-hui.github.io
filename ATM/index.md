## Summary 
<p align = "justify"> 
Airway segmentation is a crucial step for the analysis of pulmonary diseases including asthma, bronchiectasis, and emphysema. The accurate segmentation based on X-Ray computed tomography (CT) enables the quantitative measurements of airway dimensions and wall thickness, which can reveal the abnormality of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Besides, the extraction of patient-specific airway models from CT images is required for navigation in bronchoscopic-assisted surgery. Due to the fine-grained pulmonary airway structure, manual annotation is however time-consuming, error-prone, and highly relies on the expertise of clinicians.  
<br/>
We collected 470 CT scans from multi-sites and multi-domains. The airway tree structures are carefully labeled by three radiologists with more than five years of professional experience.  
<br/>
We encourage the participating teams to design robust algorithms, which can extract the airway tree structure with high topological completeness and accuracy for clinical use.
